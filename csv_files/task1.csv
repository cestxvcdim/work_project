Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"As soon as spring brings a new growth of bushes and berries, bears start feeding. They eat and eat. All through the spring and summer their feeding goes on. The bears build themselves up. They store food and fats that they will need in the fall when they start their long sleep.

As days grow shorter, and the temperature begins to fall, bears hunt for a sleeping place. It may be a shallow cave, or a deep crack between rocks. Some bears end up sleeping in hollow logs. Logs seem to be bears’ favourite places. Bears seem to choose small spaces. They can keep warmer in a cave that’s just large enough to hold them than in a larger cave. They often line their sleeping place with leaves and dried grass.

All through their winter naps, bears will not eat. Often they will sleep for 7 months, moving only now and then."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Many lands that had once been swamps were drained or filled in. There are different reasons why people drained swamplands. Some were drained to fight diseases caused by insects that lived in them. Because swamps were considered unpleasant places in which to live and harmful to health, many people thought that unless they were drained the land was worthless.

Other swamps were drained to make new land. As the population grew and more land was needed, people drained swamps or filled them to make room for more farms and factories, more roads and airports.

Few people thought that it might be harmful to get rid of swamps. As swamps disappeared, other things happened. There were both more floods and more droughts than before. There were also more fires, for swamps had acted as firebreaks. Hunters noticed that there was less wild game. Wild life that once lived in the swamps was dying out, because it had no place to live."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"When you are thinking of starting to live green, your cooking habits are probably the last area where you think you need some improvement. However, being smart in the kitchen is very important for a truly eco-friendly lifestyle. One important example is that you can lose a lot of heat if you open an oven door while baking something. Even if you do it for a short period of time, it will take a significant amount of energy to heat the oven back up.
Another important problem is buying pre-packaged products. Billions of plastic packages like milk bottles or coffee capsules end up in landfills. It is much better to buy products with packages that can be recycled. Use energy-saving cooking methods and turn on your dishwasher only when it's full. Don't buy too much food not to throw the leftovers away. These simple steps are in fact a great contribution to fighting environmental problems."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"At that time the British took advantage of new railway lines built to carry people and goods from one part of the country to another. For the first time people could travel long distances quickly and cheaply. Steam engines were used to power locomotives as well as boats. One more improvement was the setup of a cheap postal service. Streets were lit by gas lamps, so they became safe. Special men lit the lamps every evening. People could also travel around the city cheaply using the horse-drawn buses. Some people, even women, started to ride bicycles. So, Great Britain and the British people were celebrating their wealth."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"Scientists are certain that the art of writing was known to the Chinese as early as
2000 BC. It is not very easy to lear the Chinese writing system. This is so because the Chinese language doesn't have any alphabet. Each word of the language is represented by a symbol or even a combination of several symbols. This means the language has to have as many symbols as the total number of words in it.
It is enough to know about 25,000 symbols to use Chinese in the written form well. One may think it is a hopeless task to learn so many symbols. However, it is not like that because many symbols look like the corresponding real life objects.
Considering the number of symbols in the Chinese language, it is especially interesting to know that the Chinese invented a kind of a printing press in the 10th century. It is much earlier than the printing press in Europe."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Rabbits are nice looking small animals. They look much like hares and have long ears and short tails. They live in most countries of the world. There are some interesting facts about rabbits. For instance, there are over 150 colours of coats of rabbits but only five colours of their eyes. One more funny fact about rabbits is that they can hear what is happening behind them without tuming their head.
At first people treated rabbits as a good and cheap source of tasty meat and fur for winter clothes. However, rabbits breed too fast - a rabbit can have up to 38 babies in one year. That is why in many parts of the world they have become pests. Some countries such as Australia still find it really hard to control the constantly growing population of rabbits. Now many people like to keep rabbits as pets. They are quite friendly and allow children to play with them."
Культурно-исторические особенности своей страны и стран изучаемого языка,К,Говорение,"At its height the population of the city of Rome was probably over 1 million people. However, the Roman Empire was an agricultural society. Most people there made their living from farming. It means that only a small part of the population lived in towns. In the Roman Empire there were two types of people
- citizens and non citizens. Roman citizens had certain privileges. Women had a kind of limited Roman citizenship. They could not vote or hold a public office.
Many of the inhabitants of Rome were slaves. Prisoners of war were made slaves and any children slaves had were also slaves. A slave's life was terrible. Most were probably treated reasonably just to keep them working well. Slaves who worked in mines probably suffered most. Some slaves did manage to save enough monev to buy their freedom. Others were granted their freedom by their owners."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"More and more people all over the world try to live green. That means they have to recycle. Recycling is the process of sorting and collecting rubbish and using it to create new products. It is an excellent way of preserving natural resources and saving energy. That is why everybody should know that more than a half of what we throw away can be successfully recycled. We can recycle almost anything. The most common materials to recycle are plastic, glass and paper.
Recycling is very important for the mankind. Only if we recycle our litter, we can get rid of huge landfills which take a lot of space and cause the global warming.
Recycling also helps to save our forests from being cut down. It is interesting to know that recycled materials produce up to 73% less air pollution. It is up to the common people to sort their fubbish and recycle things."
"Школьное образование. Изучаемые предметы, отношение к ним. Каникулы",Р,Говорение,"Education is vital for modern people. Now in most countries one can get education for free. However, it was not like that in the past. In ancient Rome people did not have any formal education. Parents but not schools provided children with knowledge and skills at that time. These could be military, domestic or agncultural skills.
Then schools appeared. They were only for boys between 9 and 12 years old who came from wealthy families. Girls could not study there. Roman schools taught wnting and speaking skills and poetry. Foreign languages were also very important. Students had to leam some subjects in Greek to help them master this difficult language. Best students got books as a reward from schools. That was a very expensive present as books were rare at that time. School teachers were deeply respected by the Romans and eamed a high salary."
"Здоровье и забота о нём, самочувствие, медицинские услуги. Здоровый образ жизни",Г,Говорение,"Modern medicine is developing very fast. New important discoveries are m cientists every day. Still, you should not think that in ancient times medic primitive. In the Roman Empire doctors made very important discover nout them modem medicine would have been impossible. nan doctors were mainly Greek slaves. At first they were poor and I try low status. Later Roman doctors began to write books about illnesses ir treatment. In the first century BC a Roman doctor suggested that mals like rats caused disease. Unfortunately with no modem equipment the s no way of testing his theory. The Romans were also skilled engineers, a y created a system of public health. They also knew that dirt could be a reas disease. That is why they paid special attention to keeping their towns clean."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"A long time ago men learnt how to make structures with walls and roofs to protect themselves from bad weather and wild animals. These ancient structures were quite primitive and very different from modern buildings. Still, they gave people shelter and comfort which they needed. Now there are many types of buildings in the world. They vary in size, shape and function.
There are several factors which influence the construction of a building. Firstly, builders need to consider which building materials are available or suit better.
Secondly, they must know what a building is going to be used for. Moreover, they should think about land prices and climate in the area where they are going to construct a building. It is not a very good idea to build a house with big windows in the north or construct a lot of detached houses in the city centre where land is very expensive."
"Досуг молодёжи: посещение кружков, спортивных секций, клубов по интересам. Переписка",Е,Говорение,"A hobby is an activity you enjoy doing, it is something of your choice, something unique to your taste and talent. A hobby can improve our well-being; it can give more meaning to our life. Just as physical exercise is important for the body, relaxation of the mind is also essential. In fact, studies reveal that people who cultivate themselves through such activities are less likely to suffer from anxieties, depression and other negative feelings. A hobby is the easiest way to restore your balance whenever you are over-worked or stressed. Since it is an activity of your choosing, it will always give you pleasure and help you to relax. Even if you indulge in your hobby for a short period of time, you still can feel the difference in your energy level and spirit. When you have a hobby, you will always find time for it."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"The first maps were drawn by explorers to help them find their way home and show people where they had been. The maps showed the shape of the land, distances between places and special features such as caves and old trees. Nowadays, maps show the towns and villages, and the roads, railways, rivers and mountains. Symbols are used to show all the different things on a map and there is a key to explain what the symbols stand for.

Over the centuries, people explored most of the Earth and put together the map of the world we use today. Maps of the world or large areas are often either “political” or “physical”. The political map shows territorial borders. The purpose of the physical map is to show features of geography such as mountains, soil type or land use including roads, railroads and buildings.  "
"Досуг молодёжи: посещение кружков, спортивных секций, клубов по интересам. Переписка",Е,Говорение,"People have enjoyed sports for thousands of years. Children, men and women play sports both for pleasure and for challenge. Every sport involves physical skill. Every sport has a set of rules that the players of the sport follow. In some sports one person competes against other individuals. Examples of these sports include boxing, tennis and so on. In many games one team competes against the other team.

People can go in for winter and summer sports. Summer sports are typical for warmer countries. Those who live in regions that experience cold winters have long enjoyed ice skating, skiing, and sledding. These activities have grown immensely in popularity over the years. Today thousands of resorts cater to the winter tourist trade, and millions of people each year take winter sports vacations."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"The Stone Age man used natural glass. He found it by chance. He used it to make weapons, ornaments and money. Then people learned to produce glass. We don't know much about how it happened. They say that Africa was may be one of the original centers to make glass. Ancient traders sold glass in the Mediterranean countries.
Egypt was one more country where people could make glass at an early time. The first glass object was created around 3500 BC in Egypt. We know for sure
that this industry was very popular in Egypt. The Egyptians learned to press glass into molds. In the 1st century local craftsmen discovered how to blow glass. Before that, glass was very expensive. Only really wealthy people could buy glass. Thanks to this invention, everyone could afford it. Egypt produced a lot of glass things. We can still see some of them in museums."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"It is hard to imagine the world today without air travel. In the past people were always dreaming about the sky. We know many old legends about ancient people who learned to fly. We can still read these myths in books. Heroes of these books had some magical power. In the 18th century people started to use hot air balloons. This is how they travelled by air. Then the invention of planes changed the way we travel. It made travelling very easy. Planes gave us a great
chance to explore every part and corner of the world. Coping with natural disasters like floods also became much easier.
The Wright Brothers from the USA invented the first airplane. It happened in the 19th century. After high school they started to do experiments and research to develop an airplane. Their interest and passion for planes led to the development of the first plane."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"People use paper every day. Still, few of us think about where and how it was invented. In the past people used various plants to write. It could be bamboo or rice. They also had animal skins to write. Paper was invented in China many centuries ago. It was thin and made from vegetable fiber or old cloth. The technology of producing paper moved from China to Japan. Then it moved to Korea where they usually made it from tree bark.
Only much later the invention spread to the Middle East. As the legend goes, the secret of making paper was obtained from two prisoners of war. Then the first paper mills were founded. Both Spain and Italy claim to be the first to manufacture paper in Europe. Until the 19th century, rags were the main ingredient for paper. Then people discovered that wood could be pulped and turned into paper."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"A plant is a living organism. It can't move. It can't feel either. Scientists divide plants by their structure and method of reproduction. There are two main types of plants. The first type is flowering plants. They have flowers and seeds. The second type is flowerless plants. They do not have flowers and reproduce by small one-celled spores. Both types of plants can be of a different size and complexity. The main parts of a plant are the leaves, flowers, stems, roots and
seeds. A seed has its own food supply. Later it will help the future plant to grow. Stems grow upward above the ground. There are leaves in a pattern along the stem. Roots give support to plants.
Plants need food. Some of them are self-supporting, others are dependent. Plants get their food from water and air. Some plants make oxygen as a result of the feeding process."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"A river is fresh water flowing across the land surface. All rivers start at the highest point in an area. It can be a mountain or a hill. There rainwater or melting snow forms tiny streams. As the river flows downstream, it gains more water. It gets water from other streams, rivers, springs, added rainfall, and other water sources. When one stream meets another, they merge together. This may
result in a bigger river. Usually, rivers flow to a larger body of water. It can be an ocean, a sea or a lake. We call the end of a river its mouth.
Rivers flow in channels. The bottom of the channel is called the bed. The sides of the channel are called the banks. In the past, people preferred to build settlements along rivers. Rivers give us water for irrigation and drinking. Rivers
also provide us with food, energy and transportation routes."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"A mountain is a form of land that rises high in a limited area. It is higher and steeper than a hill. Mountains must be higher than 600 meters. They consist of rocks and earth. They usually have steep, sloping sides. They also have sharp or slightly rounded peaks. Some mountains may have trees which grow on their sides. Very high mountains may have snow on their peaks. Long chains or
groups of mountains are mountain ranges. They can be short or very long. A group of these makes a mountain system.
Mountains exist on every continent of our planet and even beneath the ocean. In fact, some of the highest mountains are at the bottom of the sea. For example, Hawaii is at the top of a volcanic mountain in the Pacific Ocean. More than half the mountain is below water. 75% of the world's countries have mountains."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Birds live everywhere. They vary from pigeons in big cities to penguins in the Antarctic. However, all birds have similar features. For example, they all have wings. Still, not all of them can fly. All birds also have feathers. In fact, birds are the only living animals that have feathers. Birds build nests, in which female birds lay eggs.
Birds are warm-blooded. It means that their body temperature stays about the same. It doesn't depend much on the temperature of their surroundings. Mammals, including humans, are also warm-blooded.
Birds have always fascinated people. Many people keep birds as pets. We also enjoy watching them in the wild or at zoos. In addition, farmers raise chickens, ducks and geese for their meat and eggs. Also, some people are quite fond of bird hunting.

Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Scientists have been trying to get into the world of animals for a long time. One of their goals is to learn to communicate with every living creature in their language. In fact, animals do not use language in the same way that people do. However, many animals do communicate using sounds. For example, dogs can whine, bark or snarl. These sounds may express fear, danger, hunger, or other information. A chicken can produce more than ten signals whereas a dolphin
has a range of more than twenty different sounds.
Some birds, such as the gray parrot, can even copy human speech. Once a parrot managed to learn 120 words, which is amazing. Nevertheless, humans are the only animals that can use speech to express ideas. Even if animals are trained to reproduce sounds similar to those used by people, it's still not speech."
"Досуг молодёжи: посещение кружков, спортивных секций, клубов по интересам. Переписка",Е,Говорение,"Ice hockey is a popular team sport. It developed in Canada from games played with sticks and a ball which was later substituted with a puck. Both men and women play hockey in schools and clubs, on amateur and professional teams, on national and international levels. Ice hockey is usually played on a surface called a rink. Several boundary lines run across the rink. Two blue lines divide the rink into three zones.
Hockey is a rough sport, with a great deal of body contact between the players. Hockey players wear ice skates and move with great speed and skill across the ice. The game starts with a face-off in the center of the rink. Two teams of six players compete to score the most points. A team scores when it moves the puck into the opponent's goal. Now ice hockey is a part of the Winter Olympics both for men and women."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Corals are sea animals that stay in one place during their lives. Corals can be very colourful underwater, but most types fade when they die or when they are removed from the water.
Corals live in all the oceans of the world, in places where the water is warm. Some types live alone. Many types live together in groups called colonies. In fact, several different types of corals together can form really huge colonies. These colonies are called coral reefs. They look like plants.
People have long used corals to make decorations. But this and other human activities have put many corals at risk. Rising ocean temperatures, oil spills and chemical pollution harm corals. Boats that float over reefs may also damage corals. People must do everything they can to protect them from extinction."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Everybody knows about ants. Ants are small insects. They are usually yellow, brown, red or black. In various stories and fables ants are shown as hardworking creatures. They seem to be moving all the time, carrying objects to their homes. Ants can lift about 20 times their own body weight, which is amazing.
Ants are social insects. This means that they live together in organized communities called colonies. Ants are found almost everywhere in the world,
but they are most common in hot areas. They make anthills or live under the ground. Some cultures use ants for food and medicine. However, in many countries ants are considered pests. This is so because they can get into cupboards around the house. In fact, ants are very hard to remove from the house as it is difficult to destroy a whole colony of ants."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Everybody knows about ducks. The duck is a water bird. There are about 100 species, or types, of ducks. They are found almost all over the world. These birds are rather small. Soft inner feathers protect them from cold. A gland near the tail produces oil. This oil helps protect the outer feathers from water. Most types of ducks feed at the water surface. They dip their heads below the surface while tipping up their tails. They eat many plants and insects.
Many ducks nest on the ground near water, but some types nest in trees. They take care of their ducklings until they can feed themselves and then let them roam free. Many types of ducks migrate, or fly long distances to spend different seasons in different regions. People keep ducks for their meat, eggs, and feathers. Some hunters shoot ducks for sport."
Праздники и знаменательные даты в различных странах мира,У,Говорение,"People all over the world love Christmas. In English-speaking countries it is the 25th of December. It is a time for buying and giving presents, having parties and being with family.
People start to get ready for Christmas in late October or early November. Shop keepers decorate their shops with lights. They do it because shoppers start to look for presents. Shops are very busy at this time and stay open late.
People with family and friends in other countries often send them cards and presents. Everyone begins to make plans for the coming holiday. Most people
buy Christmas trees and put them inside the house. They put colourful decorations on them. They also sing carols. Children enjoy Advent calendars with little doors for each day until Christmas. Every day they open a new door and see a picture or a chocolate inside."
Праздники и знаменательные даты в различных странах мира,У,Говорение,"Like everywhere else, people in English-speaking countries enjoy different festivals and celebrations in each of the four seasons. Food, family and flowers
are an important part of most celebrations. Most people like to have a family dinner on such days. A lot of people give chocolate and other sweets as presents, and some festivals have their special food.
Restaurants and cafés are usually very busy on these days. As for flower shops, they sell a lot of flowers. People today often live far away from their families, so they send greeting cards at special times like Christmas, or Mother's Day, or Easter. Post offices and telephones are very busy too. Of course, times change, and festivals also change. But people have celebrated many of these festivals for hundreds of years and will still enjoy them in many years."
Праздники и знаменательные даты в различных странах мира,У,Говорение,"Most children love Christmas. In Great Britain the holiday begins on the 24th of December. People stop their work early and gather at home with their kids. Parents cover the presents in special paper and put them under the Christmas
tree. Children leave a stocking for Santa Claus when they go to bed.
Santa Claus is a big man with white hair and red clothes. He brings presents for children during the night. If the house has a fireplace, the children sometimes leave their stockings by the fire. They are sure that Santa Claus comes down the chimney. Mothers and fathers tell their children that Santa Claus only comes when they are sleeping. However, children find it difficult to sleep well at Christmas night. In the morning they wake up early to see what Santa put there for them. After breakfast they open their other presents around the tree."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"If you want to think and live green, the first thing you should reconsider is how you use water. Water shortages are a big problem all over the world. So, it is important to get serious about saving water. Check if there is any leak and fix it as you may be losing a lot of water because of it.
There are also many lifestyle changes you can introduce to save more water. Don't run the tap when you brush your teeth. It's also a good idea to install a special water-saving shower head. You may also shorten your time in the shower and prefer showers to baths. If you are going to use a dishwasher or
a washing machine, make sure it's full. It will also help you to save water and energy. You can use only cold water to wash your linen and collect grey water for watering plants. Finally, a lot of water is wasted in the kitchen while cooking or rinsing dishes, so install special devices to control the use of water in the kitchen."
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"Electricity has changed our life in many ways. We can now stay up longer and devote more time to work, studies or entertainment because we don't depend on the daylight anymore. Still, lighting your home needs energy, and you should never forget about energy-saving measures in your household. If you want to run an eco-friendly household, an important thing is to invest in
the right light bulbs. Energy-saving light bulbs are more efficient than the old ones. They have actually been in our shops for a long time, but it has taken people much time to come round to the idea. Energy-saving light bulbs are slightly more expensive than ordinary ones but they are certainly not a waste of money. Such light bulbs use much less electricity thus cutting your electricity bill down. They also last longer, which means you don't have to spend money replacing them. One energy-saving light bulb can substitute six ordinary ones."
"Повседневная жизнь и быт, распределение домашних обязанностей в семье. Покупки",А,Говорение,"If you are looking for ideas to design your living space, think about your friends' homes which truly inspire you. When you visit your friends and family, think how you feel in their homes. You may find some of them cluttered with too many decorations or being too bold for your style. However, even such houses may give you an idea of what you certainly don't want to have in your
flat.
Understanding how you feel in actual living spaces can help you find out which style you want to bring into your own home. If there is a home in particular where you feel comfortable, relaxed, and rested, you should think about what elements of these living spaces you like best, and which ones you can copy. Moreover, if you have a friend who has a style much like your own, ask him or her to help you as you work on your own room design."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"If you want to live green, you will have to reconsider many aspects of your life.
Housecleaning is certainly one of them. We clean our homes on a regular basis, but we rarely think about what products we use to do it. Using harmful chemicals to clean is very bad for the environment. When you wash them away, you are simply putting them into the global water supply. This means water will have to take more purification before it is safe enough to use it again.
The obvious solution is to use natural products like vinegar, lemons and soda which can easily cope with most dirt in your house. When you go shopping for cleaning products, make sure they don't contain any harnful ingredients. Do not forget that some cleaning products may actually be toxic and thus damage your health, so check for that as well. This is an easy way to contribute to fighting pollution all over the world."
"Повседневная жизнь и быт, распределение домашних обязанностей в семье. Покупки",А,Говорение,"When you are going to design a room, it is a good idea to think about
the psychology of colour. When you plan your space, keep in mind that different colours, textures and layouts can have an impact on the way people feel in your room. Colour in particular can influence people's mood. Red is associated with passion and anger, and can even cause headaches. It is
a great accent colour for one wall, or for a couch or another piece of furniture, but some experts suggest that you should not paint an entire room red. Green is associated with calm and rest, and is a great colour for living rooms and bedrooms. However, too much green might take the energy out of a room, so you should combine it with a bit of red or orange to counteract its calming effects. Blue is also known as a calming and intellectual colour, but it can also appear cold unless you choose a blue with a warm base instead of a cool base."

Культурно-исторические особенности своей страны и стран изучаемого языка,К,Говорение,"It is very difficult to say when the picture postcards originated. The evolution of the picture postcard reflects the history of the post service in the world. It is also connected with innovations in printing and photography. We may say the history of the picture postcard started with the postal reform in the UK in the 19th century. This reform made the cost of domestic mail delivery very cheap. The person who wanted to send the mail had to pay for it. A stamp was a way to show that you paid for your mail. Sending mail became popular. People were interested in nice paper and envelopes for their letters. That was the time when a scientist from Austria offered to make cards for sending short messages. Everybody liked the idea very much. The first postcards had very simple designs, but now you can buy beautiful cards with various pictures on them."
"Здоровье и забота о нём, самочувствие, медицинские услуги. Здоровый образ жизни",Г,Говорение,"Physical activity is an essential part of people’s development. Exercising as little as 30 minutes a day can greatly improve your health. Exercise makes us strong, fast, patient and disciplined. Regular physical activity is important for our overall health and well-being. Physical exercise strengthens the immune system, improves mental health and helps prevent such diseases as heart and cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.

Regular exercise can help improve your mood, reduce the risk of chronic disease, increase energy levels and even improve sleep. Exercise causes endorphins to be released in the brain. Endorphins are chemicals produced by your body that reduce pain and can make you feel happier.

That is why exercise is the best remedy for depression and stress. Exercise also increases the flow of oxygen to the brain and improves mental clarity and memory.

If your goal is to increase your life span and to have good health, you should lead a healthy lifestyle."
"Здоровье и забота о нём, самочувствие, медицинские услуги. Здоровый образ жизни",Г,Говорение,"In Ancient Greece sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in Olympia, an area of flat land and an ancient religious centre in the west of the Peloponnese in Greece. The Ancient Olympic Games featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events.

During the games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished. The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia.

The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues. The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. Scholars think that the last Games were held in 393 AD"
"Научно-технический прогресс, его перспекти- вы и последствия",С,Говорение,"The word 'money' is believed to originate from a temple located on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. On one of the Capitoline's peaks, the temple of Juno Moneta stood where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.

Modern money consists mainly of paper bills, coins and cheques. But before coins and banknotes were introduced, other things such as precious metals, gold, beads, beans, rice, metal disks or shells served as money. In the fourth millennium BC the Egyptians used gold bars of a set weight as a medium of exchange. According to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins. Modern scholars think that these first stamped coins were minted around 650-600 BC. The first banknotes appeared in China in the 7th century.

In the past people also used a barter system (a system of exchanging goods and services directly for other goods and services rather than using money). The process was extremely difficult and time-consuming. That is why it was decided to invent a unit of account to specify price."

Здоровый образ жизни",Г,Говорение,"Genetically modified foods are foods derived from genetically modified organisms, such as genetically modified crops or genetically modified fish. GM crops are developed by changing a plant's genetic structure in order to help the plant resist against diseases caused by insects or viruses or to produce larger crops. Scientists first discovered that DNA can transfer between organisms in 1946. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1983.

There are controversies around GM food. There is no scientific conclusion so far to prove its safety for human consumption. Producers of genetically modified food say that it has a number of advantages in terms of price, durability and nutritional value. They claim that there is no risk to human health. There are also some supporters that see GM crops as providing benefits to the environment through a reduction in the use of pesticides.

The European Union, Australia, China and other countries require GMO labeling. Such labeling is not required in the United States and in Russia, although possible side effects connected with the use of GM products have not been studied."
Природа и проблемы экологии,И,Говорение,"Pollution started from the prehistoric times when man created the first fires. But it was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. Industrialization brought people into conflict with the natural environment. The emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal and other fossil fuels gave rise to air pollution.

In some cities the air is so polluted that it is hard to breathe: the concentration of smoke is so high. Factories emit tons of harmful chemicals. Transport is a major user of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum. Cars produce exhaust fumes which destroy the ozone layer protecting the Earth from the dangerous rays of the Sun. Smoke pouring out of tall factory chimneys and traffic jams have become commonplace in any big city. Rivers and seas are filled with industrial and nuclear waste, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The quality of drinking water leaves much to be desired.

Studies have estimated that water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day. The discharge of polluting matter into rivers, lakes and seas kills fish and water plants. Oil spills from damaged oil tankers are extremely dangerous. Oil turns into a thin film which prevents fish and underwater vegetation from breathing and they die very quickly."
Жизнь в городе и сельской местности. Проблемы города и села,Б,Говорение,"A city is a relatively large and permanent settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town within general English language usage, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.

Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation. A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs. Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis. Towns and cities have a long history. The growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other parts of the world, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. Today the world’s population is slightly over half urban, with millions still streaming annually into the growing cities of Asia, Africa and Latin America."

It happens because heat cannot escape through the upper levels of the air surrounding the Earth. The consequences of the greenhouse effect may be disastrous: arctic ice is gradually melting, sea-level is rising. As a result, all coastal areas may be flooded.

Global warming is the result of overheating of the air. It is caused by carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels which collect in the space around the Earth. Acid rain contains harmful quantities of acid. It is mostly caused by emissions which react in the atmosphere to produce acids. Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and buildings. Besides, it has adverse impacts on human health. Ozone depletion refers to the slow decline of ozone in the Earth’s stratosphere. Ozone is a protective layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation which is produced by the Sun. Ultraviolet radiation may cause skin cancer and affect the growth of plants."

It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. The word ‘technology’ can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques.

Man’s use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food. The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel and to control their environment. Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.

Technology has affected society in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped to develop more advanced economies, including today’s global economy. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technologies have been used for peaceful purposes. The development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons."

The question is, if humans evolved from fishes, where did the other pair of nostrils go. The answer is that they migrated back inside the head to become internal.

Similar gaps between the teeth can also be seen at an early stage of the human birth. When they fail to join up, the result is a cleft palate.

Seventy percent of the world’s fresh water is found there in the form of ice, and its wind speeds are the fastest ever recorded. The unique conditions in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica are caused by so-called katabatic winds. These occur when cold, dense air is pulled downhill simply by the force of gravity.

Compact disc players also make use of it because when mixed with arsenic it transforms an electric current directly into laser light.

Francium is one of the rarest elements. It has been calculated there are only ever thirty grams of it present on Earth. This is because it is so radioactive it quickly decays into other, more stable elements. So it is a liquid metal, but not for very long – a few seconds at most. It was the last element to be found in nature.

But what was the purpose of the paintings? Why were they hidden in a dark room where there is no evidence that cave people lived?
No one really knows, but there is one theory that makes great sense. It is called the theory of Sympathetic Magic. According to this, the cave people believed that if they could make a likeness of an animal, they could put a spell over it. This spell would give the tribe power over the live animal.
Stone Age existence depended on killing animals – for food, clothing, and even weapons and tools. The animals were large and fierce; the cave people had only the most simple weapons. Hunters had to be brave and fearless. They needed more than a spear or club; they needed all the magic they could get. The magic could help the hunters catch the animals."

The idea that one should knock on wood for good luck, for example, is a 4,000-year-old custom that began with some Native American tribes of North America.

They also thought that boasting of a future personal deed was bad luck and meant the thing would never happen. Knocking on an oak tree was a way of contacting the sky god and being forgiven for boasting.

Another interesting superstition is that it is bad luck to open an umbrella indoors. In eighteenth-century England, umbrellas had stiff springs and very strong metal spokes. Opening one indoors could indeed cause an accident. It could injure someone or break a fragile object. This superstition came about for practical reasons."
